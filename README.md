Hi, I’m Andrei Titov.
I’m interested in Product Security, Application Security, Security Architecture and Secure SDLC.
I’m currently learning how to hack and protect web- and mobile apps, cloud APIs and microservices.
I’m looking to collaborate on secure software development as Security Expert.
I'm CISSP and CISM certified cyber security pro.
